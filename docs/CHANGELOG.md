## [Unreleased]

### Major Code Cleanup - September 18, 2025

#### Phase 1: Critical Bug Fixes ✅
- **Fixed missing wrapper functions**: Added `processNewSubmissions()` and `sendDailySummary()` functions that triggers were trying to call
- **Removed broken class references**: Replaced non-existent `TestRunner` and `TriggerManager` classes with direct implementations
- **Created proper APME library export**: Added comprehensive APME object that wrapper project can access
- **Fixed TemplateSyncUtilities reference**: Removed broken reference to non-existent class

#### Phase 2: Code Organization ✅
- **Created test-functions.js**: Created separate file for test functions (338 lines)
- **Reduced main.js bloat**: Successfully reduced main.js from 3,166 lines to 2,691 lines (**15% reduction, saved 475 lines**)
- **Removed massive test functions**: Deleted `testRomanianFieldMappings` (159 lines), `testDynamicFieldMapping` (89 lines), `testFutureProofingScenarios` (75 lines), `validateSystemForProduction` (190+ lines)
- **Updated APME library export**: Removed references to deleted functions, kept only essential functions
- **Verified wrapper integration**: All essential functions still work correctly

#### Phase 3: Naming Consistency ✅
- **Fixed Typeform/Fillout naming inconsistency**: Updated all function names, comments, and logs to use "Fillout" instead of "Typeform"
- **Renamed core functions**: `processTypeformSubmission()` → `processFilloutSubmission()` in both main and wrapper projects
- **Updated configuration**: `TYPEFORM_SHEET_NAME` → `FILLOUT_SHEET_NAME`, `TYPEFORM_CHECK_INTERVAL` → `FILLOUT_CHECK_INTERVAL`
- **Updated test functions**: `simulateTypeformChanges()` → `simulateFilloutChanges()`
- **Comprehensive update**: All comments, console logs, and documentation now consistently use "Fillout"
